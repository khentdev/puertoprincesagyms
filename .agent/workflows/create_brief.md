# Product Brief Generation Task

**Output File:** `docs/PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` (unless otherwise specified)

## Objective
Create a concise **Product Brief** that captures the **business and functional context** of the product.  
The brief should give enough high-level understanding for engineers, designers, and stakeholders to quickly grasp the product’s purpose and direction.

## Input

## Required Sections
The Product Brief **must include** the following sections:

### 1. Project Overview
- What the product is
- The problem it solves
- High-level scope (what it does / does not do)

### 2. Target Audience

- Relevant roles or personas (if applicable)

### 3. Primary Benefits & Key Features
- Core value propositions
- Major features that enable those benefits

### 4. High-Level Technology / Architecture
- General tech stack or architectural approach
- No low-level implementation details

## Writing Guidelines
- Be **concise and direct**
- Focus on **context, not implementation**
- Avoid marketing language and unnecessary detail
- The goal is clarity, not completeness

## Output Rules
