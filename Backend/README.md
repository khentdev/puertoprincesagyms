# Backend Template

This is a personal backend template designed for rapid project initialization and fast iteration.

It consolidates standardized coding patterns extracted from previous projects to ensure a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) workflow. This template significantly speeds up setup compared to writing boilerplate code from scratch.
